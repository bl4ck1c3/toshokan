= Relevance testing

spec/relevance contains tests to check the validity of search results wrt precison and ranking, 
using rspec-solr.
The tests are turned off by default, but can be run with '--tag relevance' option.

It uses the solr path defined for the TEST environment in solr.yml as default,
but can be (and should) be overwritten by setting the ENV variable 'SOLR_URL'.

Remember to tag new relevance tests with the 'relevance' tag.
